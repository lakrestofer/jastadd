Consider an interface with an equation defining an inherited attribute via getChild(). A node directly implementing the interface cannot override this equation by using getChild(). The result will be a double declaration. This behavior is questionable. Future development might allow such specifications. For the moment, you can program around this behavior by instead overriding the equation for each child individually, using the specific getters instead of getChild().
