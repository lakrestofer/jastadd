Abstract grammars are declared in `.ast` files. For example, an abstract
grammar may look like this:

$include(Grammar.ast)

JastAdd generates Java classes for each node type declared in the abstract
grammar. These classes can inherit from each other. In the above example class
`B` inherits from class `A`. JastAdd also generates three implicit classes;
`ASTNode`, `List`, and `Opt`.

The full class hierarchy of the above grammar is:

#AstClassDiagram

`ASTNode` is the supertype of all other AST classes. The `List` and `Opt`
classes are container classes for list- and optional components of nodes in the
grammar.

The Java classes generated by JastAdd are created in the source directory
specified by the `--o` option, and the package name is specified by the
`--package` option. For example, if JastAdd was invoked using the command `java
-jar jastadd2.jar --package=ast --o=src Grammar.ast`, then the classes would be
generated in the `ast` package, in the `src/` directory.

The following code demonstrates creating an instance each of the generated
classes `A` and `B`:

$include(Test.java)
