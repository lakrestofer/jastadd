An AST node can have an optional component:

$include(Grammar.ast)

Here the node `A` has an optional child `B`. This child is represented
by an instance of the `Opt` node. When a new `A` node is constructed
one must add `B` wrapped in an `Opt`, or just an empty `Opt`:

$include(Test.java)

#TestOutputAsDiagram
