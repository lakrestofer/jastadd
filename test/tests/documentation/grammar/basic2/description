In order to create a useful abstract grammar it is necessary to have grammar
nodes with child components, for example:

$include(Grammar.ast)

Here the node `A` has two child components of type `B` and `C`.  JastAdd
generates a constructor for each node that matches the declaration in the
`.ast` file. An AST can be built using these generated constructors:

$include(Test.java)

The above code constructs the following AST:

#TestOutputAsDiagram
